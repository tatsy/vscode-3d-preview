## Description

This extension is inspired by [vscode-3dviewer](https://github.com/stef-levesque/vscode-3dviewer) but has minimal features to preview triangular meshes, and point clouds.

## Features

This extension supports 3D formats equally as [Open3D](http://www.open3d.org/docs/0.9.0/tutorial/Basic/file_io.html) (but partly not support currently).

## FAQ

* Q. When I drag&drop a mesh file, a blank display is shown.
    * A. To show a 3D data using this extension, you should first open a workspace including the 3D data that you want to open.
